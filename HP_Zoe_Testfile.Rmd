```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

1. Load packages and read in data
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

hp_data <- read_csv("harry_potter_aggression_full.csv")
```
I did a thing! Critical place to SAVE THIS VERSION
can keep this version stored somewhere, in case I need to look back at it

2. Basic wrangling and make graph of Harry Potter vs Draco Malfoy aggression rates

```{r}
hp_graph <- hp_data %>% 
  filter(Name == "Harry" | Name == "Draco Malfoy") %>% 
  select(Name, book, agg.per.mention) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= book, y = agg.per.mention))+
  geom_col(aes(fill = Name), position = "dodge")+
  coord_flip()+
  theme_bw()

hp_graph
  # will automatically make a stacked column graph --weird cause it combines into one, so we wanta  clustered column graph -- added postiion = "dodge"
```
